# Bio 302 Independent Research Project


*Bio 302: Introduction to Bioinformatics* will culminate in your asking and answering a research question of your own. You'll submit your project as an executable ipython notebook containing a mix of prose, data, code, and references to the literature, along with any supporting files to make the submission self-contained. Your project will analyze at least one publicly-available dataset. As noted in the syllabus, this project is worth 25% of your course grade.

Your project is due during the allotted final exam period for Bio 302, which is 10:45 AM - 1:15 PM, Monday, May 16th, 2016. You will submit a project proposal at the beginning of class on Thursday, April 14th, 2016. This project proposal will be graded as a small portion of the total project grade. You’ll receive extensive feedback on your proposal from the instructor.


## Project Proposal

Your project proposal should be about a page. It should be typed, and follow the writing guidelines in the “General” section of the rubric below. It must include:

- some basic background on the area you’re working on, including 3+ relevant references
- the question you’re going to be asking
- an outline of your methods for answering the question
- the url to at least one of the datasets you propose to use

## Finding Your Question

Finding an idea to work on shouldn’t be too hard, and will hopefully be fun. You can do a project that’s more mathy, like on BLAST statistics, or you can do one that’s really asking a biological question, like on the evolution of olfactory receptors in primates.

First off, if you’re already involved in undergraduate research, picking a bioinformatic aspect of your research topic can be a great idea -- in that case, raise the issue with your advisor and see if you can drum up some ideas.

You can just google “bioinformatics <interest>”, where interest might be “cancer”, “dolphins”, “neanderthal”, anything, and bounce around.

I’d suggest looking through the Wikipedia page on bioinformatics, and looking throught the back half of our textbook; you get a reasonably comprehensive listing of the areas of research there. What’s interesting to you?

You get the idea. Use the web, guided by your interests, and pick something that sounds cool.

Of course, you can email me a/o come to office hours.


## Grading Rubric for Bio 302 Final Project

The characteristics of strong work are laid out below. In addition, your work should be executable; I should be able to load your submitted notebook and run it without error. (That implies that you should test that your project is executable before you submit it.)

### Introduction

- States purpose and focuses on appropriate topic
- Includes appropriate background
- Cites relevant references where needed
- Clearly identifies relevant and appropriate question
- States testable hypothesis that relates to question


### Methods & Materials

- Describes all data, procedures and software completely, states assumptions
- Study design and analyses are well thought-out and appropriate
- Includes all measurements and units


### Results
